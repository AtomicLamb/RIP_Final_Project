May the hair on your toes never fall out! Never laugh at live dragons, Bilbo you fool! \'You have nice manners for a thief and a liar,\' said the dragon. May the hair on your toes never fall out! May the hair on your toes never fall out! In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. May the wind under your wings bear you where the sun sails and the moon walks. Never laugh at live dragons, Bilbo you fool! May the hair on your toes never fall out! Where there\'s life there\'s hope. May the wind under your wings bear you where the sun sails and the moon walks. Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning whether I want it or not; or that you feel good this morning; or that it is a morning to be good on? \'You have nice manners for a thief and a liar,\' said the dragon. Where did you go to, if I may ask?\' said Thorin to Gandalf as they rode along.  To look ahead,\' said he.  And what brought you back in the nick of time?\' Looking behind,\' said he. In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. May the hair on your toes never fall out! Never laugh at live dragons, Bilbo you fool! Never laugh at live dragons, Bilbo you fool! Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning whether I want it or not; or that you feel good this morning; or that it is a morning to be good on? It does not do to leave a live dragon out of your calculations, if you live near him. In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. There is nothing like looking, if you want to find something. You certainly usually find something, if you look, but it is not always quite the something you were after. Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning whether I want it or not; or that you feel good this morning; or that it is a morning to be good on? Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning whether I want it or not; or that you feel good this morning; or that it is a morning to be good on? May the wind under your wings bear you where the sun sails and the moon walks. ','So comes snow after fire, and even dragons have their endings. In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.
